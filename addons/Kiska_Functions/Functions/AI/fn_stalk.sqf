Function: KISKA_fnc_stalk

Description:
    Rewrite of BIS_fnc_stalk for optimizations and features.
    One provided group will continually be provided waypoints to another group's
     positions providing a "stalking" affect.

Parameters:
    0: _stalkerGroup <GROUP or OBJECT> - The group to do the stalking
    1: _stalked <GROUP or OBJECT> - The group or unit to be stalked, if group is used, 
        the leader will be stalked until every unit in the group is dead
    2: _refreshInterval <NUMBER> - How often the _stalkerGroup will have their waypoint
        updated with the position of the _stalkedGroup, and how often to check the _conditionToEndStalking
    3: _postStalking <STRING, ARRAY, or CODE> - Code that after stalking is complete
        will be executed. (See KISKA_fnc_callBack _callBackFunction parameter)
    4: _conditionToEndStalking <STRING, ARRAY, or CODE> - Code that (if returns true)
        can end the stalking. (See KISKA_fnc_callBack _callBackFunction parameter).
        The stalking will automatically end if all units in one or both groups end
        up dead.

Returns:
    NOTHING

Examples:
    (begin example)
        [
            someGroup,
            group player,
            15,
            {hint str _this},
            {false}
        ] spawn KISKA_fnc_stalk
    (end)
